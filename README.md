# RockPaperScissor


### Description:

This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissor game. We have player and computer scores at the left and right side respectively.
You have the let's Play option which when clicked should fade out and show you two sides one for player on left and other
for computer on the right.

On the bottom you have options for selecting rock, paper or scissor. For Selecting the option for computer we declare 
an array with the options available, then we use a Math.random function to generate random numbers from 1 to 3 considering
we have three options. We use that as a index to the corresponding values in the array to get what computer selected as an
random option. The images are updated on screen with respect the option choosen by the player and the computer


We declare a function to check the option selected by the user and computer and a series of if and else check to see
who is the winner based on the rules of the game while also simultaneously updating the scores as well.
